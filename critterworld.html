    <h1>Critter World: Simulating Evolving Artificial Life</h1>
    <p><em>Fall 2024</em></p>

    <p>Created by Anne Xia, Carrie Chen, Haohuan Li, and Francis Lau at Cornell University. Final project for
        <a href="https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs2112/2024fa/">CS 2112: Object-Oriented Design and Data Structures Honors</a>,
        taught in Java by Professor Andrew Myers for Fall 2024.</p>

    <p>The goal of this project was to simulate critters (animals) on a hexagonal grid world. Critters can perform various actions,
        such as moving, eating food on the grid, or reproducing. Each critter contains a program, which is the language
        that determines what action the critter takes at each time step.
    </p>

    <p>
        To achieve this goal, we used recursive descent parsing to convert programs into abstract syntax tree representations, which
        could then be evaluated to determine critter behavior. We used the model-view-controller design pattern to ensure separation of concerns,
        and this allowed us to first test our parsing and simulation using the console before moving everything to a finished GUI application. For
        our GUI app, we used JavaFX to build the base app and CSS for styling. Finally, we used multithreading to ensure smooth performance within the app
        even while a simulation was running in the background.

We chose to add eyes to the critters and represent food as hamburgers because it would be immediately clear to the user what each icon is meant to represent."
