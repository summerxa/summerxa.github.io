            <p><em>Fall 2024</em></p>
            <!-- <p><em>Fall 2024</em> | Java, UI, Multithreading, MVC </p> -->

            <p>Created by Anne Xia, Carrie Chen, Haohuan Li, and Francis Lau at Cornell University. Final project for
                <a href="https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs2112/2024fa/">CS 2112: Object-Oriented Design and Data Structures Honors</a>,
                taught in Java by Professor Andrew Myers for Fall 2024.</p>

            <p>
                A GUI app that simulates an ecosystem as it evolves in real-time.

                My main contributions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Architect code using model-view-controller design pattern.</li>
                        <li>Implement designs and write unit tests to verify correctness.</li>
                        <li>Write all UI, including interactive map, and multithreading with background model.</li>
                        <li>Organize team discussions and troubleshooting sessions.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p>The goal of this project was to critters (animals) on a hexagonal grid world. Critters can perform various actions,
                such as moving, eating food on the grid, or reproducing. Each critter contains a program, which is the language
                that determines what action the critter takes at each time step.</p>

            <p>
                To achieve this goal, we used recursive descent parsing to convert programs into abstract syntax tree representations, which
                could then be evaluated to determine critter behavior. We used the model-view-controller design pattern to ensure separation of concerns,
                and this allowed us to first test our parsing and simulation using the console before moving everything to a finished GUI application. For
                our GUI app, we used JavaFX to build the base app and CSS for styling. Finally, we used multithreading to ensure smooth performance within the app
                even while a simulation was running in the background.
            </p>
