            In a city where the powerful feast and the poor starve, you're the last hope.
            As the new food bank president, you see the truth. What starts as a mission to help quickly uncovers deep corruption;
            food hoarded by the powerful while vulnerable communities suffer. Carefully pack nutritious meals from limited supplies.
            Secretly deliver food to the starving, forging bonds and risking exposure.
            This emotionally driven strategy game challenges you to confront the global crisis of hunger and waste,
            and asks: how far would you go to make sure no meal or person is forgotten?
        </p>

        <p>
            The block-fitting puzzle is one out of two puzzle minigames made to complement the game's narrative.
            In each level of the puzzle, players are given a grid and blocks in various shapes and sizes, with each block corresponding
            to one out of three "food groups". Players are tasked to fill the grid as much as possible, making sure to use
            the required amount of blocks for each food group. This mechanic is designed to teach the player the importance of having
            a balanced diet.
