        <p>A time management and choice-based narrative game, currently in beta testing process.</p>

        <div>
            <p>
            My main contributions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented all the time management gameplay and the custom UI & menus.</li>
                    <li>Designed and implemented custom code structures in Python to extend game engine's limited API.
                        Focused on creating a scalable system, such that new features and levels can be added with minimal adjustment to base code.
                    </li>
                    <li>Designed features for time management gameplay.</li>
                    <li>Communicated regularly with team members to ensure integration of gameplay with visuals and story.</li>
                </ul>

        <p>
            Navigate the life of a doll-like maid named Anastasia as she serves multiple clients and gets acquainted with her fellow maids.
            Whether she'll remain cold or slowly warm up to her emotions will depend on your choices.
            As a maid, she must manage her time wisely to complete all the tasks given by clients.
        </p>

        <p>
            The time-management gameplay is integrated with the narrative. Players must allocate their in-game time between navigating the map and
            completing various tasks to increase their score in three separate categories. The goal is to earn a high enough score in all three categories
            (indicated in game by a filled-in progress bar) within the time limit.
            As a challenge, the game tracks players' actions and will gradually decrease the final score if too much in-game time elapses without
            completing a task.
            In addition, certain tasks contain cutscenes that progress the narrative; to ensure that the player will always reach these scenes,
            we deactivated all other tasks until the narrative was completed.
        </p>

        <p>Demo of the time management game's tutorial. The occasional pixellation effects are caused by lag from the browser,
            not by the game itself.
