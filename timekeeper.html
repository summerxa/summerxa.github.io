Scenes not yet reached by the player are grayed out with a lock icon."

Each furniture item on the map is interactable when clicked, and clicking the correct ones will progress the game and narrative. The buttons on the left sidebar opens various menus that help guide the player, and the clock indicates the player's remaining time. On the top right, we included progress bars that fill as the player advances, which helps the player track their current performance. The tooltip on the bottom left provides various hints for the player depending on their gameplay actions."
